			<p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is calculated based on an hourly average of the atmospheric particulate counts. Confidence value is a measure of how well the two sensors agree. A low confidence value indicates a problem with one or both of the sensors.</p>
			<p><strong>AQI 0 - 50 : Good</strong> - Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.</p>
			<p><strong>AQI 51 - 100 : Moderate</strong> - Air quality is acceptable. However, there may be a risk for some people, particularly those who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.</p>
			<p><strong>AQI 101 - 150 : Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups</strong> - Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects. The general public is less likely to be affected.</p>
			<p><strong>AQI 151 - 200 : Unhealthy</strong> - Some members of the general public may experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.</p>
			<p><strong>AQI 201 - 300 : Very Unhealthy</strong> - Health Alert: The risk of health effects is increased for everyone.</p>
			<p><strong>AQI 301+ : Hazardous</strong> - Health warning of emergency conditions. Everyone is more likely to be affected.</p>
